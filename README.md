#Welcome to my Workout Tracker App!

This program creates a workout app using a react front end and an express backend using the rest API. 

##How To Use

To use this program, copy both folders into a directory, go into each folder and run npm install in the 
command line in the terminal to install the necissary files to run the program. After doing this, simply
run npm start in both folders and open up localhost:8000 in your browser and start adding workouts!
